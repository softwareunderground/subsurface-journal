Quickstart
==========

  1. Create a pull request with your notebook and requirements for any libraries it depends on 
    * Create a fork of the journal repository in your own github namespace
    * Create a branch ( `git checkout -b my_submission_name`), add your notebook and dependencies, commit and push the results and follow the link to create a PR for the journal ) 
  2. This should include any data and supporting libraries needed to run the notebook
  3. Your submission will be automatically checked for executability
  4. Style guidelines? (Document layout, code style, writing style?)
  5. Tags or categories? (Are they assigned up-front, how are PRs annotated)


What happens next?
==================

Your submission will be assigned to two or more reviewers from the `Software Underground<https://softwareunderground.org/>` community. Requests for changes and comments will be offered as comments on your pull request.

If your notebook is accepted by the Journal as an executable publication it will get issued a DOI.
