Introduction

Subsurface Letters is to act as an outlet for subsurface science and engineering. The aim is to provide a platform for the dissemination of executable and reproducible ideas. This can take the form of a new use case for existing open source software, the development of new algorithms that might one day become part of a software package, or the exploration of scientific ideas. At the core, we seek submissions that give worked examples, contain reusable code and ideas, and while all models are wrong, they will be useful.

Letters are to be short and concise. They can contain code and/ or figures, and are to be submitted in the form of a notebook (currently we have focused on notebooks and python code, but this should not become a python journal, so this should be changed.) The software used within the letter must be in an open repository and include an OSI approved open source license. Letters must include a title, a list of author names and affiliations, an abstract, an introduction, and key references. Submission is via github as outlined in the Contributions stub.

The mission of Subsurface Letters is to promote reusable and reproducable research within the community and to allow us to build upon the knowledge of the community.
